# Isometry
# By Damian Yerrick, 2006
# This piece was composed to time a workout.  It is nominally in
# D flat mixolydian, but because it uses bVII and bVI chords (the V
# and IV of the relative major of the parallel minor), double flats
# are abundant. So I respelled it to C sharp mixolydian.

# Happy Flappy Crappy
# By Damian Yerrick, 2015

song bf98
  title Happy Flappy Crappy

  # Carl Orff invented a different notation for time signatures.
  # Top is beats per measure, bottom is the head and downward stem
  # of a note that is 1 beat on the A (treble) or C (bass) space.
  # Writing 9/8 as "3/(dotted quarter note)" makes compound
  # prolation in particular easier to understand.
  # We can't include pictures of notes in a score, but we can
  # allow dotted durations in a denominator.
